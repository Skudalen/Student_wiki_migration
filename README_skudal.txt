After performing 'migrater_skudal.py', the file structure with altered .md-files be present. 
The example in 'pages_migrated_example' is derived from 'python migrater_skudal.py "pages" "./pages_migrated_example"
Currently there is a problem with a few files. These are:
- UnocodeError in :./pages/55.usaa/archive/archive/03.info/daco.old.md
- UnocodeError in :./pages/predmety/03.usaa/archive/03.info/daco.old.md

My suspision is that these are corrupted, but it needs to be investigated.
